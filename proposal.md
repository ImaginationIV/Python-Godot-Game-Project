# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Scribble Defense(or something along those lines)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to create a tower defense game where the player gets to customize their projectiles and towers.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want to have some sort of like drawing system where they can draw their towers and stuff. I also want to have like abilities that they can give their projectiles.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I don't plan on using their courses, I do have experience with web and game development, So I think I can learn how to use Godot independently.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Just me

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be a few levels designs, an enemy or two, the drawing system and some variation in the tower abilities.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A good outcome would be a tower defense game with a campaign mode, several enemies, story, variation in the towers.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to make a few videos about my game or fully release it on a platform.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn a about godot. I'll most likely be using GD Script and will need to learn how to write it. I will also need to learn how to connect my godot project to github. I will need to research game design to understand how to make the tower defense mechanics fun. I will also need to learn how to create UI and Art for games.
