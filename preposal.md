# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to create a godot game. I'm leaning torwards creating a Tower Defense Game but I might also try to create a Basketball game.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Me, Myself and I

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If you have any suggestions for how I should go about learning how to use godot or godot's languages that would be helpful.
